important admin-y files
=======================

All files are stored in `etc/` rather than in the root directory - otherwise,
you'd get this file and a couple others cluttering up your `/etc`.

These files are like dotfiles, but not user-only stuff, so I figured they
should be elsewhere.

To install, run `install`.
