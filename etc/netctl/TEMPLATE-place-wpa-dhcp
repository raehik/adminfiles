# You can use the plaintext passphrase, or generate a PSK from the passphrase.
# The latter means the key isn't kept in plaintext, so I suggest a PSK.
# Generate the PSK:
#     $ wpa_passphrase <ssid> <passphrase>
# Then enter it into the Key variable, prepending \"
#     i.e.    Key=\"0123456789abcef    for PSK
# rather than Key="plaintextkey123"    for passphrase
