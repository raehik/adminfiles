/etc/nologin.txt: Login is disabled for this account.
This should show up when you try to `su` to an account with their default shell
configured as `/usr/bin/nologin`. It's like `/usr/bin/false` but shows a helpful
message too. (You can of course login anyway by changing the shell started.)
Intended for system accounts like http, which shouldn't be logged in to.
