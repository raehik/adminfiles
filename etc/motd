This is an MOTD, or "message of the day". You can put cool things like current
system uptime and users, and maybe showcase the best scores on your favourite
terminal games.
You can change this message at `/etc/motd`.
You can choose whether to print the 'last login' line by changing the line:
    PrintLastLog yes
at /etc/ssh/sshd_config to:
    PrintLastLog no
This seems to only affect SSH logins, though :'(
You can choose whether this message is even printing by commenting out the
line:
    session    optional   pam_motd.so          motd=/etc/motd   
at /etc/pam.d/system-login i.e.
#    session    optional   pam_motd.so          motd=/etc/motd   
You can also choose which file will be used for the MOTD.
You can make a better MOTD by disabling this one and running a shell script on
login!
